Homework 13

This is Homework 13 in the UNC Coding Bootcamp curriculum. The purpose of this app is to give a quiz or test with numerical answers, then compare those numerical answers to the ones of arbitrary scoring seed users already in the system.

This means that the user takes the quiz, then sends the information to the database. The back end coding sums the users individual numerical scores and finds which database user is closest, then returns that database user and their picture in a results page that the user is direction to.

I was unable to get this app working on heroku. My files are as is, and reflect the coding and logic that was created for this project.
